Entity and relation extraction are the key tasks in the construction of biomedical knowledge graph, which play an important role in the biomedical artificial intelligence. Previous pipeline approaches divide the task into two separate subtasks, but these methods fail to solve the error propagation problem. Recent approaches are proposed to perform these two subtasks jointly but most existing methods suffer from the imbalanced interactions and independent features issues. In this paper, we proposes a joint method based on feature partition encoding and relative positional embedding to extract biomedical entities and relations simultaneously. Our work has two contributions. Firstly, our method divides the features into task-specific and shared parts through entity, relation and sharing partitions at the encoding stage. Then, we aggregate the encoded features according to the subsequent tasks. Secondly, our method introduces a relative positional embedding method to capture the relative distance information between token pairs. In this way, our method can effectively deal with the subtasks interactions problem and improve the performance of entities and relations extraction. The experimental results on four biomedical datasets show that our proposed method has achieved SOTA performance.
